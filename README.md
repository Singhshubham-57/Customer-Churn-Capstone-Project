# Customer-Churn-Capstone-Project
# Introduction
Welcome to the Customer Churn Analysis project at Neo, a leading telecom company. This project aims to analyze the data to understand why our customers are churning out to our competitors and devise strategies to reduce churn rate, retain customers, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

# Project Overview
In this project, we will be conducting a comprehensive analysis of customer churn using historical data collected from our telecom services. The primary objectives are as follows:

### Data Preprocessing: We will clean, preprocess, and prepare the data for analysis. This step includes handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will perform EDA to gain insights into customer behavior, identify patterns, and discover potential factors contributing to churn.

### Feature Importance: By applying various machine learning techniques, we will determine the most significant features that impact customer churn.

### Model Development: We will build predictive models to forecast customer churn and identify high-risk customers who are more likely to churn.

### Model Evaluation: The predictive models will be evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their performance and effectiveness.

# Data
The dataset provided for this analysis contains information on customer demographics, usage patterns, services subscribed, contract details, and churn status. It is divided into two main subsets: historical customer data (including churn status) and customer usage data.

# The dataset consists of the following features:

Customer ID
Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, etc.)
Tenure: The duration of the customer's subscription
Services subscribed (e.g., internet, phone, TV, etc.)
Monthly Charges: The amount billed to the customer monthly
Contract details (e.g., contract type, payment method, etc.)
Churn Status: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No)

# Tools and Technologies
The analysis will be carried out using various data science tools and libraries, including but not limited to:

Python programming language
Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and modeling
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration and analysis
Project Workflow

# Conclusion
The goal of this project is to understand why customers are churning out to competitors and implement effective strategies to minimize churn rate. By analyzing customer behavior and identifying key factors contributing to churn, we can proactively address customer concerns and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

We believe that this Customer Churn Analysis will empower Neo Telecom with data-driven insights to take informed actions and improve customer retention, thus ensuring our position as a leading telecom provider in the market.
